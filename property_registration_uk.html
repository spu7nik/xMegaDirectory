  <h2>What is the Land Registry?</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.elandregistry.com" rel="dofollow">Land Registry</a> is a government department that manages the register of land and property in England and Wales. It holds official records on ownership, boundaries, charges, and rights affecting the property.</p>

  <h2>Why Register a Property?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide legal evidence of ownership</li>
    <li>To prevent fraud and illegal transfers</li>
    <li>To enable faster sale or mortgage processes</li>
    <li>To safeguard your rights against third parties</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When Must You Register?</h2>
  <p>Property registration is mandatory in the following cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When buying or selling a property</li>
    <li>Transferring ownership through inheritance or gift</li>
    <li>Creating a mortgage or lease longer than 7 years</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Register a Property</h2>
  <h3>1. Check if the property is already registered</h3>
  <p>Use the Land Registry search service to see if the property is listed.</p>

  <h3>2. Prepare documentation</h3>
  <p>You will need the sale deed, identity verification, and any additional legal documents.</p>

  <h3>3. Submit application</h3>
  <p>Apply using forms like AP1, FR1, or TR1, depending on the situation. Include title plan and payment of the registration fee.</p>

  <h3>4. Await confirmation</h3>
  <p>Once processed, the Land Registry issues a title deed confirming ownership and rights.</p>

  <h2>Title Deeds Explained</h2>
  <p>The title deed (also known as title register) contains essential data such as the owner's name, property description, covenants, charges, and restrictions.</p>

  <h2>Common Issues</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Unclear boundaries on old deeds</li>
